#predict grades

I made a bot in golang where you can predict your grades, I compiled it to a .exe btw.

you can:
  -predict your grades
  
  -generate motivation
  
  -choose a study method
  
  -customize the grades bot

**you have to customize it because it is now by it's default customized on MY grades**

***I would not recommed to quit my typing "4" in the main menu when you are TESTING the bot, I think that's why my browser marked the file as a virus***
